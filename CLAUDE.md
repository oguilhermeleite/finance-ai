# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a basic web application with three core files:
- `app.html` - Main HTML structure
- `app.js` - JavaScript functionality  
- `app.css` - Styling

## Development

This appears to be a simple static web project. All files are currently empty and can be opened directly in a web browser.

To run the application:
- Open `app.html` in a web browser
- Or use a local web server: `python -m http.server` or `npx serve`

## Architecture

Simple client-side web application structure with separate concerns:
- HTML for markup
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactivity

No build process, package manager, or framework dependencies detected.
